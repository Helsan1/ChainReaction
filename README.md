# ChainReaction

What is ChainReaction?
=============

Between 2 and 8 players are displayed on a rectangular board with a default of 8 rows and 5 columns. Each player has pawns of a certain color.
Alternatively, each of the players will place one of their pieces either on an empty case or on a case already containing one or more of their pieces.
When you are on an adjacent business, that you have found the ones you are in, you have found those who appeared, you added pawns to them. If the adjacent cases were enemy pieces, they are captured, they change color and the new piece is added next.
Post it on the road of postions. If so, the phenomenon recurs and so on. So we can witness a chain reaction.
A player has lost as soon as he is no longer among the players on the board. The winner is then the last remaining player.
